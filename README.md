## Online Multiplayer Pig Dice Game Instructions:

**Objective:**
Be the first player to reach 100 points by rolling a dice and accumulating points, but be careful not to roll a 1, which will cause you to lose your accumulated points for that turn.

**Setup:**
1. Open the online multiplayer pig dice game.
2. Click on "New Game" to start a new match. All scores will be reset to zero.

**Gameplay:**
1. The game is played in turns, with each player taking their turn in sequence.
2. On your turn, a single dice will be displayed.
3. Click the dice to roll it. The value rolled will determine your score for that turn.
4. The points you accumulate on your turn will be shown in a temporary box.

**Rules:**
1. If you roll a 1 on the dice, all the points in your temporary box are lost, and your turn ends. It becomes the next player's turn.
2. To continue accumulating points, you can choose to roll the dice again by clicking it.
3. Each time you roll the dice and get a non-1 value, the points are added to your temporary box.
4. You can keep rolling the dice and accumulating points until you decide to "Hold."
5. If you choose to "Hold," all the points in your temporary box are added to your total score, and your turn ends. The next player's turn begins.
6. Players switch turns whenever one player decides to "Hold" or rolls a 1.

**Winning:**
The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game. As soon as a player reaches 100 points, the game ends, and that player is declared the winner.

**Note:**
This game is designed for multiplayer, so make sure to take turns with other players. Pay attention to your accumulated points and the risk of rolling a 1 to make strategic decisions.
